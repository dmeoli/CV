        \item {In the context of \textbf{Artificial Intelligence Fundamentals} exam, in the fields of \textit{Search, Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP), Logic} and \textit{Planning}, I developed several algorithms for solving problems formulated according to one of these models, such as \textit{AC3b}, \textit{AC4}, \textit{GAC}, \textit{CDCL}, etc.; paying particular attention to the definition, where possible, of translators able to convert a specific problem's definition according to another one of these models. Some examples are \textit{SearchPlan}, \textit{CSPlan}, \textit{SATPlan}, etc.. All of these algorithms were submitted and merged in the official \href{https://github.com/aimacode/aima-python}{GitHub repository of Norvig's book, \textit{Artificial Intelligence, A Modern Approach}}.}

      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
        \item {In the context of \textbf{Industry 4.0} for the \textit{Predictive Maintenance} scenario, I deployed as a Docker container an end-to-end Machine Learning platform for the \textit{Multiple Multivariate Time Series Prediction} composed by Cesium ML algorithms for time-series inference (e.g., Random Forest, Linear Regression, etc.) and a custom Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model trained in Keras.}
        \item {In the context of \textbf{Smart City} for the \textit{Smart Bins} scenario, I trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the recognition of waste to be differentiated into paper, plastic, glass, or undifferentiated and I deployed it as a Docker container in Tensorflow Serving to made it available through RESTful API.}
        \item {In view of the participation at the \textbf{Mobile World Congress 2019} in Barcelona I deployed in TensorFlow Serving a pre-trained object detection model for the real-time recognition and counting of people present on all Exprivia S.p.A. stands.}
